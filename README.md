# About me


Hi! My name is Franek, and I'm a young individual in the final years of my engineering studies. I've always been interested in programming, particularly in C# and SQL languages. I have professional experience where I use C#, T-SQL, and other tools on a daily basis to create high-quality software. I'm very committed at work and strive to leverage my skills to solve problems and deliver valuable projects. Thanks to my approach and hard work, I'm confident that I'll be able to tackle even the most significant challenges in the future.
